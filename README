Use the IDE or text editor you want :) here are the Makefile to use the STMVL32DISCOVERY on Linux,
with st-link (https://github.com/texane/stlink) and gcc-arm-none-eabi. Everything come with a little blinking demo.

STMF10X Device drivers Librairies  and linker files are downloaded from 
http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/PF250863

All are put in the stm32lib folder, core files are in the cmsis folder and linker, startup, and 
other devices files are in the device/ folder. 

Construct the project (stored in the inc/ and src/ directories) by simply entry in a shell:

make 

and load it to the stm32 with

make load

Change inc/stm32f10x_conf.h for new includes :)

Use of vpath.

TODO :
- A more bad-ass demo
- Scripts for debugging with gdb
- Check the compiler flags
